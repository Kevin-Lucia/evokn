"""
In this implementation,

of k-nearest (kn) neighbors an item is assessed for its deviation from evolving
prototype attributes. If close enough to an attribute, then a dendrite for the
prototype is activated. Enough dendrites/attributes activated, will allow the
nearest neighbor holding those attributes to reach threshold.
Another kn search is initiated from the neurons/neighbors that reach threshold.
At every level of 'depth', class labels are summed from each of the neurons that
reach 'threshold'. A 'refractory period' can be utilized to prevent recurrent
activations during each item's association, for every level of depth during
non-rapid evolution. During rapid evolution, the entire prototype changes--frame
by frame--with each level of depth; and is only refractory during the current
frame for activated neighbors.


Matching narrow requirements,

is assumed to be the purpose of evaluating rapidly evolving tasks. For example,
matching a fit for a landmark in an enzyme target pocket with drug candidates.
If the following were utilized for such a purpose, then an object would be made
for each landmark's ideal traits. A score based system is adopted for rapidly
evolving tasks (see revo()).
Though both rapid and non-rapid prototypes are set to evolve, rapid prototypes
immediately change the entire prototype--which are frames in time (any amount of
time). All the evolution for rapid tasks is written into revo().


Adapting for a changing environment,

is the aim of the non-rapid evolutionary kn search implemented. The items that
are classified eventually become the prototype for comparing things to follow.
It seems to be the natural order of things to change in value over time. The
rate of prototype changes can be adjusted with 'flow', 'epoch', 'evo_n', and
'prune' attributes (descriptions below).

                     after each nearest neighbor activation for non-rapid
                     evolution. For rapid-evolution, depth is initiated for the
                     nearest neighbor at the level of activation (see revo()).
        rp         : Refractory period--non-rapid neighbors are refractory if
                     activated at any depth. Rapidly evolving systems are
                     refractory only during a single frame. The frame of the
                     prototype shifts in time with every level of depth

                      New members from evolution are added to the bottom of the

                      that same list.
                      Setting to 0 will start at the top--newest--of the
                      labeled items, and any negative starts from the back.
                      However, note that with negative values you are indexing
                      from a constant item (at the end) and there will be no
                      added information by running learn() and evolving()
                      without constantly modifying 'epoch' (which is possible,
                      and on some occasions desirable). That is, indexing from 0
                      always pulls information from newly introduced members to
                      the population.

                      be reached.
                      During rapid evolution, epoch is the size of one frame
                      within a prototype (all frames). For example, one frame
                      could be the specific point in time at which multiple

         evo_n      : Number of newly labeled items to add to prototype, and
                      label. Collected from the start of epoch, down. Or in any
                      order calling evolving() multiple times. Items are added
                      to the bottom of the prototype.
         prune      : Number of items removed from the current prototype as
                      they first appear.
                      Removed items follow a multiple of the newly classified
                      labels starting from the current epoch. Prune is for
                      non-rapid evolution.

                      'flow', 'prune', 'epoch', and 'evo_n' are adjustable

        When prototypes evolve rapidly,

        'B (past)' is closer to high value 'C' in a future expected model--'A'
        deserves a higher score. This model was designed to account for the
        value in tracking all stable states through time. Parts of the frame
        that are compared to the item being evaluated, are in turn compared to
        future parts of the frame. If they are close to themselves in the

        first: valuable. All of these scenarios follow because a split second
        earlier, or later, the item under comparison was similar.
